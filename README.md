# Introduction

Hello folks,

My name is Ronald and I am an avid Software Developer. You'll tend to find me working on personal projects related to table top role-playing games in some way. Though you may have a tough time finding them, since I tend to provide them under my gamertag. And in the interest of keeping the two lives separate I'll not be directing you to them.

That said, here is where I do the bulk of my contributions to other open source projects that I find interesting, or that I am using in the mentioned personal projects.

# Interests

Software, Tabletop RPGs, and Books are likely my top three hobbies.

### Software

I've taken a deep dive into Software Architecture of late and how this relates to DevOps. I'm a bit late to this kubernetes craze, but aCloudGuru has a few wonderful classes that got me up to speed. This kicked off a dive down several rabbit holes that lead me to some fun subjects. For example, [freeBSD's Jails](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Jails), [jamStack](https://jamstack.org/), and [Salt Project](https://saltproject.io/).

It was funny to learn that freeBSD's jails have been around since 2000, which beat out Docker by about 13 years. Still, all just tools in the toolbox.

### Tabletop RPGs

Pathfinder has been my bread and butter for a long while. I swear I could be a table judge with the knowledge I've picked up about the system. I'm not a big fan of D&D 5E, or Pathfinder 2E. They lack some of the somewhat wacky rules interactions you can get in Pathfinder 1E. Such as gliding underground to repeatedly punch your foe into the air, effectively juggling them.

If you're wondering how, look at [Item: Giant Fist Gauntlets](https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Giant%20Fist%20Gauntlets), [Feat: Vicious Stomp](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vicious%20Stomp), [Rule: Falling](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Falling&Category=Environmental%20Rules), and [Ability: Earth Glide](https://www.aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Earth%20Glide). I think you'll start to see how I did it. And if you want details feel free to ask, I'll be happy to share the build with you.

Other than pathfinder I've started to really enjoy the Champions system. The rules for constructing your own abilities is just amazing. Though the system can be a bit much, so I've also been looking at BESM(Big Eyes Small Mouth).

### Books

This is something I neglected for a few years, but I've been getting back into of late. I used to tear through books in high-school, and I'm steadily making my way through some older favorites of mine. Namely books by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and Garth Nix.

# Currently Learning

In the interest of not having to keep this section constantly up to date I'm going to be vague here.

I'm finding my learning aligns well with my interests in Software. I'm enjoying the process of finding and consuming new libraries and projects as I come across them and I look forward to finding even more.

# Contact

If you want to talk to me, the best platform for that is likely [twitter](https://twitter.com/RonaldMZeal).

Not to say I won't respond to messages here as well, just less frequently.
